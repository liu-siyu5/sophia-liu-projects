# Assistive Exoskeleton Technology Research

**Duration:** October 2024 – Present  
**Location:** Boston

## Overview
Automated data pipeline and machine learning system for gait phase prediction in assistive exoskeletons.

## Technical Details
- Automated Python pipeline (Pandas, NumPy, regex) for sensor data processing
- Cutting raw‑to‑ready prep from hours to ~10 min
- Boosting usable samples by 30%
- Designed and trained TensorFlow models (CNN, LSTM, TCN) to predict gait phase
- Streamlined data flow halved experiment cycles
- Raised validation accuracy to ≈ 91% macro F1

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, regex)
- TensorFlow
- CNN, LSTM, TCN architectures
- Wearable sensor integration
- Data pipeline automation

## Results
- 30% increase in usable data samples
- 91% macro F1 validation accuracy
- 50% reduction in experiment cycles
